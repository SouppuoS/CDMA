# CDMA
Generate weights for Differential Microphone Arrays (CDMA)[1] in Python.  
生成圆阵列DMA算法的波束成形权重，具体设计参考Jacob的*Design of circular differential microphone arrays*。

## 2-STEP TO USE:
```
cma     = circular_microphone_arrays(M=4)
cdma    = CDMA(cma, sa=180, null_list=[180 + 135])
```
1) Define `circular_microphone_arrays` base on geometry of your microphone array, eg: `r` for radius (cm), `M` for the number of microphones. For now, only uniform circular array (UCA) is supported.  
2) Design your CDMA base on your microphone array, including `sa` for steer angle and `null_list` for null point list.
The order of CDMA depends on `null_list`.   

## TO ENHANCE A SPEECH SIGNAL:  
In `test.py`, an example demonstrates how to apply the CDMA built before on speech enhancement task. 
```
_, _, spec_mix_rir = ss.stft(mix_rir, fs, nperseg=(cdma.cma.f_bin - 1) * 2)
_, s_enh           = ss.istft(cdma.apply(spec_mix_rir), fs)
```
Two utterances from [THCHS30](www.openslr.org/18/) are mixed (you need to download the dataset by yourself). And we try to enhance the signal-1 from the mixed signal. The experiment are performed on data generated by pyroomacoustic.  
The specgram of clean utterances, mixture and enhanced signal are shown below.
